# ls-module-sitemap
Adds a sitemap feature for your LemonStand store

## Installation
1. Download [Sitemap](https://github.com/limewheel/ls-module-sitemap/zipball/master)
1. Create a folder named `sitemap` in the `modules` directory.
1. Extract all files into the `modules/sitemap` directory (`modules/sitemap/readme.md` should exist).
1. Login to the admin area of your store to complete the installation.
1. Done!

Alternatively, you can get the Sitemap module on the [LS Marketplace](http://lemonstandapp.com/marketplace/module/sitemap/). Add it to your license and update your store, the module will be installed with the update.

## Usage
Setup the sitemap in the System/Settings area. From there you can choose which CMS pages to include on the sitemap as well as whether or not to include individual category pages, product pages and blog posts.
The sitemap is generated using the Sitemap protocol and can be accessed in your root directory (i.e. www.mystore.com/sitemap.xml or www.mystore.com/ls_sitemap).

### Dependencies
The module requires the CMS Themes feature. If you are installing the Sitemap module manually, please ensure you have version 1.3.0 of the CMS module or later.
